# YourDigitalSelf - Android app
> A Personal Digital Trace Integration Tool.

[![NPM Version][npm-image]][npm-url]

## About
YourDigitalSelf is an Android mobile device application that gathers and integrates personal digital traces into coherent groupings that share a common theme, task or goal. This app is used as the basis to retrieve personal digital data originating from various sources to be used to implement and evaluate our research in the DigitalSelf project, through user studies and surveys. It can also act as a standalone user interface to help users navigate through their own personal digital traces in order to make sense of their data and individual patterns as well as to provide them with narrative views of their digital memories.

You can download YourDigitalSelf app in your Android mobile device, and see the results of our instantiation algorithms on a variety of real-life scripts. You can download the .apk from [here](https://github.com/yourdigitalself/YourDigitalSelfApp/releases).

It is important to stress that YourDigitalSelf keeps all data on the user’s device and therefore guarantees full privacy.
